**Introduction:**
-------------------

"Guess My Number" may seem like a simple game at first glance, but it's a perfect introductory project that covers the five fundamental concepts we focus on in our courseâ€”variables, conditionals, arrays, loops, and functions.

**Variables**: The core of the game is the "secret number" that the player needs to guess, and this is represented as a variable. Player's guesses are also stored as variables. Understanding variables and how to manipulate them is crucial for the game to work correctly.

**Conditionals**: This game is all about comparison. Is the guessed number higher, lower, or equal to the secret number? This is where conditionals come in. They allow us to control the flow of the game based on the player's input.

**Arrays**: While not immediately evident, arrays can be used to enhance the game. For instance, you could store all the player's guesses in an array and use that information to provide feedback or calculate statistics.

**Loops**: Loops form the heart of this game, allowing it to continue round after round until the player guesses the secret number correctly. Without loops, the game would end after just one guess.

**Functions**: Functions help to structure our code, making it cleaner and more maintainable. For instance, we can use functions to generate the secret number, take player input, or check if the guessed number is correct.

This project, therefore, serves as an excellent practical application of these fundamental programming concepts. Through this game, you'll understand how these concepts interact and work together to create a functioning piece of software.

However, creating a functional game isn't the only objective of this project. It's also about understanding the importance of good code.

Even in a project as simple as "Guess My Number," writing clean, readable, and maintainable code is crucial. Clear code makes it easier to understand the game's mechanics, pinpoint any errors, and make future modifications. It also allows others to understand your code, which is an essential aspect of professional programming.

Therefore, as you build this game, we urge you to keep in mind the programming principles we have covered so far.  
Use this opportunity to put these concepts into practice and cultivate the habit of writing good code from the outset.

**Project Requirements**:  
-------------------

You must work from the supplied code at [https://github.com/CodeCraftCurriculum-I/module\_1\_guess\_my\_number](https://github.com/CodeCraftCurriculum-I/module_1_guess_my_number)

Before diving into the code, draft a pseudo code and/or a flowchart for your game's mechanics, taking into account the following enhancements:

*   **Multiple Game Rounds**:  
    Adapt the game to allow the player to engage in several rounds without needing to restart the program. Consider how to manage the transition between rounds smoothly and intuitively.  
      
    
*   **Statistical Summary on Exit**:  
    Upon the player's exit, present them with a statistical overview of their gameplay. This should include the total number of rounds played, the average number of guesses per round, the total number of guesses, and any other interesting statistics you can think of. How will you store and calculate these statistics during gameplay?  
      
    
*   **Multi-Language Support**:  
    Offer the player a choice of language at the start of the game - for instance, English and Spanish. The game should then interact with the player entirely in their chosen language. Consider how you'll manage and switch between different sets of game text.  
      
    
*   **Difficulty Levels**:  
    Introduce various difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard) that the player can choose from at the start of the game. Depending on the level, adjust the range of the secret number. How will you manage this complexity while keeping your code clean and manageable?  
      
    
*   **User Interface Enhancements**:  
    Improve the user interface to be more interactive and engaging. This could include color-coded messages based on the proximity of the guess to the secret number, or encouraging messages after a certain number of incorrect guesses. How will these changes affect the flow of your game and the organization of your code?

In your README file, include a section where you highlight potential challenges or limitations in your code. Reflect on what could be done differently, and areas you believe could be improved.

All your code and related files should be neatly organized in a Zip file, with the following internal structure

    module\_1
    |-- README.md
    |-- guess.csx

**About assesment:**
-------------------

Assessment for this project will be based not just on feature completion, but also on your attention to detail, the cleanliness and readability of your code, and the thoughtfulness of your README file reflections.  
This is your opportunity to demonstrate not just what you've learned, but how you can apply it creatively and effectively in a real programming project.
